Hello and welcome to LegacyMac!
We are a community of Mac users who are passionate about keeping older versions of macOS alive. 
We do this by trying to revive apps, and make them compatible once again.

Example:

Spotify 

Firefox

Discord

and more!



Warning, some of them are web apps, as we have tested and they work fine.
